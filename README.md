# Cluedo

 Solver for Cluedo
 
 [Disclaimer: Cluedo is a trademarked something something ... Whatever. I don't even.]
 
 This is a solver, not the game itself. It is based on a computer game (by Marmalade Studio) available on Steam.
 
 ## What to expect?
 
 In short, nothing much. This is my first Haskell code apart from a few attempts of (really) basic functions.
 
 Although I program in C++ for quite a few years, Haskell is really new to me. This is the problem/code I chose to learn Haskell.
 
 To repeat; this code is a result of one week-long attempt of a C++ programmer to learn Haskell. Zero-to-Cluedo. Sure it does what it claims, but the code is ugly.
 
 Expect every beginner mistakes and totally suboptimal code. By suboptimal, I mean implementations of functions. Algorithms chosen for the solution is on a whole another level which can't be uttered in the same sentence with the word optimal.
 
 ## What does it do?
 
 Given a list of events in a game of Cluedo, this code fills the clue card. And a list of solutions if solution set is "small enough". And probability of solutions which has no real value - just a gimmick as it is now. But it may change.

 ## About license ...

 * I don't think anyone (in their right mind) will use this code. So the license was almost randomly chosen, just a tad bit on the safe side of political correctness.
 * Feel free to contact me if it does not fit your needs or you think it conflicts with proprietary licenses. It is not set in stone.
 
 ## Can I use it in my games?
 
 Yes, of course you can
     | IT = IT can be used, because it somewhat works.
	 | YOU = If you have an Haskell environment to compile, and if you can write game events (just like the examples in file "TestCases.hs" -which is really simple) then YOU can use it.
	 | USE = If it is legal to use such a program according to game vendor, then you can USE it.

 ## But program (does not have this functionality) / (can't do this)
 
 Yeah, but I don't care at this point.
